*Stefan Arentz, February 2017*

Work in progress. You can see it in action in the `validate-xliff` tool at [st3fan/validate-xliff](https://github.com/st3fan/validate-xliff)

This is a tiny package to parse `.xliff` files.

It is currently used in the following two projects:

* In [Firefox Focus](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus) to import strings from the Mozilla L10N Repository into the Focus Xcode project.
* In [XLIFF Tool](https://github.com/st3fan/xlifftool), a generic XLIFF tool that will hopefully replace a number of specialized scripts that we use for [https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-ios](Firefox for iOS) and [https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus](Firefox Focus for iOS).

> Please [file a bug](https://github.com/st3fan/xliff/issues/new) if you have some specific wish or requirement.
